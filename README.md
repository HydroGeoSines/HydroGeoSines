## HydroGeoSines: Signals In the Noise Exploration Software (SINES) for Hydro-Geological datasets

HydroGeoSines (HGS) is a Python package that allows easy calculation of Barometric Efficiency (BE) and Barometric Response Functions (BRF) from standard groundwater monitoring datasets. This includes correction of groundwater heads that are affected by barometric and Earth tide influences. BE estimations include time-domain and frequency-domain solutions. BRF analysis is based on regression deconvolution allowing either the use of Earth tide time series or automatic estimation of the Earth tide signal. A number of useful pre-processing routines are also implemented. These include import, alignement and gap handling of groundwater, barometric pressure and Earth tide time series. HGS can automatically add theoretical Earth tides to a dataset because it includes [PyGTide](https://github.com/hydrogeoscience/pygtide).
